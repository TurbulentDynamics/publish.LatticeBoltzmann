## Turbulent Dynamics Lattice Boltzmann

* Turbulent Dynamics is developing high resolution CFD codes with Lattice Boltzmann
* Bespoke applications to input geometry and post-processing                                                      
* Targeting simulations larger than a thousand cores and a million core-hours                   
* In-house hardware delivering up to 60% reduction in costs for large scale simulations
* Algorithm and HPC development
