- Turbulent Dynamics is developing high resolution CFD codes with Lattice Boltzmann 
 
 
- Develops bespoke applications to input geometry and post-processing                                                                        
               
- Targeting simulations larger than a thousand cores and a million core-hours                                                                                                         
         
- In-house hardware delivering up to 60% reduction in costs for large scale simulations                                                                                        
         
- Algorithm and HPC development
