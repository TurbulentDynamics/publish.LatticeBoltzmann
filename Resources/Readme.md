# Turbulent Dynamics Lattice Boltzmann

Turbulent Dynamics uses in-house technology to deliver up to 60% reduction in costs when running Lattice Boltzmann simulations focusing on the largest simulations above 1 million core hours.  Maintaining active research into the LB method and continously researching novel ways to maintain the fastest and minimun cost per node update.  In addition we are pioneering ways to use Machine Learning to augment Lattice Boltzmann, including inferring open boundaries and a type of domain refinment.

Turbulent Dynamics is actively recruiting LB professinals and HPC Developers.  Candidates must be willing to learn, experiment and adapte to new languages and disparate hardware, such as Rust, C++, Swift, on nVidia, Intel and AMD hardware.


Turbulent Dynamics maintains several open source Lattice Boltzmann projects
